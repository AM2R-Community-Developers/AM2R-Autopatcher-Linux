Glands in the mouth ignite its saliva, turning it into an organic flamethrower.

For protection, it distributes a portion of the organs' power into the surrounding membrane and fortifies it. Only cold temperatures can hinder this flow of energy and weaken its defense.# #Recent findings and events suggest that three of the Larva's nuclei eventually change into stem-like cells on SR388 to be used as building blocks for its later forms. But why only here? Is it something in its food, or some radiation the planet emits?"

Off-world Metroids cannot normally shed their larval form, which I believe is a side effect of their adaptations.# #The nuclei likely alter in function when the Metroid is removed from SR388, changing into specialized cells that help the creature tolerate its surroundings. This, along with new environmental factors, cause subtle or drastic changes to its body. Regrettably, the Metroid is stuck in perpetual hunger as it tries to reach a form it can no longer obtain."
