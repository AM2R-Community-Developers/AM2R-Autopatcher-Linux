FAQ
- Where are my screenshots? I can't find them anymore!
Look in your AppData/Local folder, it's usually in this location:
C:\Users\[Your User Name]\AppData\Local\AM2R

For Linux, it can be found at this location:
/home/[Your User Name]/.config/AM2R

- Why are my screenshots so big?
The screenshots are now taken with the size of the displayed window.
If you want the classic 320x240 screenshots, set the display to Windowed 1x
before pressing F12.

- Can I use save files from demos before 1.0?
No. The game has changed a lot since the demo, along with the save format.

- Can I use save files from versions before 1.4.3?
Yes, but compatability is not guaranteed. Saves are located in C:\Users\[Your User Name]\AppData\Local\AM2R.
1.0/1.1 saves use the filename savN.
1.5 saves use the filename saveN.
Some older Community Update saves use the filename saveXN.

- I have an Arcade cabinet, can I exit AM2R with just 1 key?
Sure! After running the game once, go to this folder:
C:\Users\[Your User Name]\AppData\Local\AM2R
And edit config.ini, setting the following values:
EnableExitButton=1 (should be 0 by default)
KeyboardButtonExit, JoystickButtonExit and XBJoypadButtonExit can be used to
customize which button / key is used to exit. Default is ESC for keyboard,
Back for XInput, and button 10 for DirectInput.

FAQ Continued Revisions
- Did DoctorM64 have anything to do with this?
DoctorM64 has nothing to do with this. He did not supply the source code.

- How did you get the source code for AM2R?
https://gitlab.com/users/yellowafterlife/projects

- The Fusion suit doesn't change colors for the different types. Help!
AM2R requires DirectX9.0 installed and hardware shader support to properly 
display art in Fusion mode, allow the 8-bit shader to work, and enable custom 
palettes. Until DirectX9.0 is installed and the shaders properly compile, you 
will see the message displayed on the titlescreen and the above mentioned 
features will not work properly.

The required DirectX version (June 2010) can be found on Microsoft's website here:
https://download.microsoft.com/download/8/4/A/84A35BF1-DAFE-4AE8-82AF-AD2AE20B6B14/directx_Jun2010_redist.exe

- Will you add Ridley?
._.

- Will you add new areas or powerups?
No. The development team believes that the world of AM2R is complete, and we are 
focusing on improving what exists rather than adding totally new content.

- What's the most up-to-date version?
The latest version of AM2R will always be posted at www.reddit.com/r/AM2R and will
automatically be installed if you are using the AM2RLauncher.

- What platforms is AM2R available on?
Currently, AM2R runs natively on Windows, Android, and Linux platforms.
Linux support is provided as-is and is not guaranteed to run on any given machine.
AM2R is capable of running on older Mac devices using Wine.

- Will you release the source code?
It's public! Check out the AM2R-Community-Updates repository on GitHub.

- How do I load custom title images/backgrounds/area intros?

Title images: Place your custom image within the /lang/titles/ folder. It must use the following name format: 'language_x000_y000.png'.
	- Replace 'language' with the same name as the language file you use. This is the name in the file header, not the filename. 
	- Replace '000' after both 'x' and 'y' with the necessary coordinate offsets. 
	- For example, a valid title file might be named 'english_x048_y032.png'
	- If you need a negative 'x' title offset (for say, widescreen) simply add a minus sign in front of the 'x' coordinate: 'language_-x000_y000.png'.
	
Backgrounds: Place your custom image in the same folder as your AM2R datafile. (AM2R.exe on Windows, game.unx on Linux) It must use the following name format: 'titlebackground_f00_s00.png'
	- Replace the '00' after 'f' with the number of frames in the background image.
	- Replace the '00' after 's' with the frame-per-second speed of the animation.
	- For example, a valid background file might be named 'titlebackground_f01_s60.png'

Area intros: Place your custom sprite strip within the /lang/headers/ folder. It must use the following name format: language_a0_f00_b00_c00_d00_e00.png
	- Replace the '0' after 'a' with the area ID.
		- 1. Golden Temple
		- 2. Hydro Station
		- 3. Industrial Complex
		- 4. The Tower
		- 5. Distribution Center
		- 6. [has no intro]
		- 7. Genetics Lab
		- 8. GFS Thoth
	- Replace the '00' after 'f' with the number of frames in your sprite.
	- Replace the '00' after 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e' with each of the 4 pause frame indices in the sprite.
	- For example, a valid English A1 intro file might be named 'english_a1_f24_b00_c03_d19_e21.png'

- Fixed room transition in area 3 entrance
- Fixed language file detection, the game can be fully translated now
- Added transport pipe to final area
- Other minor fixes

1.2
- There may be some bugs due to the code reconstruction. I've fixed what I've found. Just a warning.
- Fixed gravity suit leg glitch when jumping vertically
- Fixed random wall collisions
- Fixed item blocks not being solid
- Power Beam blast now can open item blocks
- Arachnus Chozo Statue is now solid

- Added option in modifiers.ini for blue item block for Ice Beam
- Added option for random item blocks (different colors) in modifiers.ini
- Fixed visual glitch with Cave Droppers
- Changed Skorp Disc hitbox
- Fixed, mostly, camera issue in area 3 where hidden area was viewable
- Fixed room in Area 2 where a player can get stuck if they don't have Screw Attack
- Changed saved file names so version 1.0 or 1.1 games are separate from version 1.2
- Changed button icons to PS buttons. Can change these back in the modifiers.ini file
	Thanks go to Craig Kostelecky here.
- Fixed issue with Tester spinning sound effect getting stuck turned on.
- Added percent of items currently acquired in character menu screen or map screen. This can be changed in modifiers.ini.
- AM2R now graphically can support 30 E-Tanks on the HUD.
	Thanks go to Craig Kostelecky here.
--------NEW GAME MODES--------
- New Game+ game mode added. This mode starts the lava at level 7, or through area 5.
	38 Metroids in area, from the start, need to be defeated.
	Basically the game thinks you are in area 5 but you have to defeat all the Metroids through area 5. The lava will not
	drain, giving you access to the Alpha before the first Omega fight, until you defeat all the previous Metroids.
	Thanks go to Craig Kostelecky here.
- Random Game+ game mode added. Most power ups are randomized on top of New Game+ rules.
	In modifiers.ini there are some options for random game mode under the EasyPickups section.
	Required to know wall jumping and basic understanding of bomb jumping may be helpful in Random Game+
	It is possible to get stuck in this game mode. Having either spider ball or space jump in some places
	can be vital to being able to get out of situations if you don't have a good grasp on bomb jumping.
	This is mainly an issue in area 5.
